# CHALLENGES-KATAS

These katas will cover different aspects of Java programming and help you improve your problem-solving abilities. Here are a few katas you can try:

1)	FizzBuzz:
    Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz." For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz."

2)	Palindrome Checker:
    Write a function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward.

3)	Anagram Detector:
    Write a function that checks if two strings are anagrams. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase.

4)  Prime Number Generator:
    Write a function that generates a list of prime numbers up to a given limit. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

5)  Fibonacci Sequence:
    Write a function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

6)  Matrix Transpose:
    Write a function that transposes a given matrix. The transpose of a matrix is formed by interchanging its rows with columns.

7)  Binary Search:
    Implement a binary search algorithm to find the index of a given element in a sorted array. If the element is not found, return -1.

8)  Linked List Operations:
    Implement basic operations for a linked list, such as inserting a node, deleting a node, and searching for a specific value.

9)  Sorting Algorithms:
    Implement different sorting algorithms, such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, and merge sort.

10) File Manipulation:
    Write a program that reads a text file, counts the occurrences of each word, and displays the most frequent words along with their counts.

These katas cover a range of topics and will help you sharpen your Java programming skills. Remember to break down the problems into smaller tasks and write test cases for each kata to verify your implementations. Happy coding!

11)  Array Manipulation:
        11.1) Find the maximum element in an array.
        11.2) Reverse an array.
        11.3) Calculate the sum of all elements in an array.
        11.4) Remove duplicates from an array.
        11.5) Find the second largest element in an array.
        11.6) Sort an array in ascending/descending order.

12) Map Manipulation:
        12.1) Count the frequency of each element in an array using a map.
        12.2)Remove entries with a specific value from a map.
        12.3)Merge two maps and handle duplicate keys.
        12.4)Sort a map by values in ascending/descending order.
        12.5)Perform various operations (add, remove, update) on a map.
        ** Pending some test:  pending test add, update, and ask value.


13) Object-Oriented Programming:
        13.1) Implement a class hierarchy with inheritance and polymorphism. 
        13.2) Create classes to represent real-world entities (e.g., Person, Animal, Car) with appropriate properties and methods.
        13.3) Implement interfaces and define their methods in concrete classes.
        13.4) Use encapsulation to hide internal implementation details.
        13.5) Apply inheritance and overriding to customize behavior in subclasses.
        ** Pending some test: 

14) Lambdas and Functional Programming:
        14.1) Filter a list of objects based on a specific condition using lambdas.
        14.2) Map elements of a list to a new list using a lambda expression.
        14.3) Perform operations such as sum, average, or maximum on a list using streams and lambdas.
        14.4) Sort a list of objects based on a specific property using a lambda comparator.
        14.5) Implement functional interfaces and use them in lambda expressions.
        ** Pending some test: 

    String Manipulation:
        Reverse a string.
        Check if a string is a palindrome.
        Count the occurrence of each character in a string.
        Split a sentence into words and count the frequency of each word.
        Remove whitespace or specific characters from a string.
        Convert a string to uppercase/lowercase or title case.

These katas cover a range of concepts and skills commonly used in Java development. Feel free to choose the ones that interest you the most and practice implementing them in your code. You can also explore various online coding platforms or coding challenge websites that offer a wide range of coding exercises and katas to further enhance your skills.
